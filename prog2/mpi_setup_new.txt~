The process for setting it up to run the first time for each user is
cumbersome.  After the initial user set-up it works well without much
fuss.

# login as self
# make file .mpd.conf  vi/emacs/pico .mpd.conf    
# in it write one line:
secretword=<secretword>

where <secretword> is a secure key you create but not your normal password
save the file. You may write:
secretword=css534

# set the correct permissions on this file (other permissions won't work)
chmod 600 .mpd.conf

# create the mpd.hosts file in your "home" directry.
The file should include a list of uw1-320 "slave" machines as seen in
~css534/lab2/mpd.hosts:

uw1-320-11.uwb.edu
uw1-320-12.uwb.edu
uw1-320-13.uwb.edu

Don't include the machine that will become your master node or rank0.
Make sure that mpd.hosts is stored in your home directory rather than
your working directory.

edit .bash_profile file - add mpich path to $PATH 
PATH=/usr/apps/mpich121-`uname -p`/bin:$PATH
export $PATH

either relogin or type at the command line:
export PATH=/usr/apps/mpich121-`uname -p`/bin:$PATH

# test that your set-up works on the current host
mpd &
mpiexec -n 1 /bin/hostname
mpdallexit

# if you get an error or warning this is a problem.  
# You should get the hostname of your current host

**  Need to be able to ssh without a password to other machines in order to
use MPICH.  If this is not already set up:
**************************************************************************
**  ssh-keygen -t rsa                                                   **
**  #  at "Enter file in which to save key", <enter> to accept default  **
**  #  at "Enter passphrase" <enter> to keep the passphrase empty.      **
**  #  do the same thing again                                          **
**  #  then go to the .ssh directory                                    **
**  # and change the name of id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys              **
**  cd .ssh                                                             **
**  mv id_rsa.pub authorized_keys                                       **
**  # ssh to all lab machines to set up                                 **
**  # first ssh need to respond "yes" to "continue connecting"          **

The first time a new host is added to the first "ring". This in turn means
that, before running mpdboot, you need to login all the slave nodes from
the master. In the above mpd.hosts example. you need to login from
uw1-320-10 to 

uw1-320-11
uw1-320-12
uw1-320-13

Thereafter, you can launch mpd at all nodes.

CSSmpdboot -n 1 -v
mpdallexit
CSSmpdboot -n 2 -v
mpdallexit
CSSmpdboot -n 3 -v
mpdallexit
CSSmpdboot -n 4 -v
mpdallexit
